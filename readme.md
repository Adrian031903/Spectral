# 🍞 Bread Van App
Flask app with Admin/Driver/Resident portals, JWT auth, Observer-powered notifications, and supporting CLI tools.

## 🚀 Quick start (local)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask init            # create tables + seed demo users
flask run             # or: gunicorn -c gunicorn_config.py App.main:app
```

### Seeded accounts (after `flask init`)
- Admin: admin / adminpass
- Drivers: bob / bobpass, mary / marypass
- Residents: alice / alicepass, jane / janepass, john / johnpass

### Sign up (web)
- Resident: requires area_id, street_id, house_number (seed data: Area 1 has streets 1-3; Area 2 has streets 4-5).
- Driver: username + password only.

### Portals
- `/portal/admin` – manage areas/streets/users
- `/portal/driver` – schedule/start/end/cancel drives
- `/portal/resident` – subscribe, request stops, view inbox notifications
